#		Convert graphics files and put in storage (which is the SD Card/USB stick in the emulator.)
#		This takes the 3 png files and creates graphics.gfx
# 
python $BINDIR/makeimg.zip
mkdir -p storage
cp graphics.gfx storage/

#		Convert source.bsc to a tokenised program
#
python3 $BINDIR/makebasic.zip source.bsc -oprogram.bas
